# This document affects your legal rights.  You must read and understand it before initialing and signing it.

## ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE

On behalf of myself and any minor listed below, I agree to and accept the terms of this Agreement even though I am signing the same via electronic format (on-line, via a website), and affirm that the same will have the same legal effect, as an actual signature of a written document. I affirm that the provisions of the Washington Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (RCW Title 1, Chapter 1.80 et. seq.) apply.

I acknowledge and agree to the foregoing terms of the Electronic Signature provision.

I, the above named person being eighteen or older in age, or the parent/legal guardian of the child/children who is/are under 18, in consideration of the right to participate in certain recreational activities, and the services of Miraworld LLC dba Mirra, and their members, directors, officers, agents, employees, other all other Mirra named and/or related entities, and owner of the subject property, LS2 Retail, LLC (hereinafter collectively referred to herein as “Releasees”), on today’s date or any future date of visit to this or other Mirra facility/location, hereby acknowledge, agree, promise, on behalf of myself, my heirs, assigns, personal representatives and estate, and/or the minor(s), as follows:

## DISCLOSURE OF RISKS

Mirra is an entertainment facility, which offers (or may offer in the future) patrons the opportunity to participate in, enjoy and/or observe a number of physical and/or recreational activities, including, but not limited to various immersive virtual reality experiences.  Based upon the unique and participatory nature of the activities, there is a risk of physical and/or emotional injury, including, but not limited to sprains, strains, bumps, bruises, cuts, smashed body parts, head, neck, or back injuries, broken bones, paralysis, or, in some remote circumstances, death. There also exists the risk of a slip, trip, or fall while engaging in these activities or presence upon the property. Note, however, that the foregoing risks are not exhaustive, and they cannot be eliminated without fundamentally altering the unique experiences involved.

Participants will utilize headsets and other equipment as part of the immersive virtual reality experience. Based thereon, each participant will not be able to see the actual environment around them; and there is a risk of falling, losing balance, or other potential injury based upon this unique experience. Also, participants will be exposed to various forms of visual stimulations, including bright lights and fast-moving objects, and the immersive virtual reality experience could cause loss of balance, dizziness, motion sickness, eye strain and vision changes, headaches, elevated heart rate, and in rare instances, strokes or seizures. Further, these immersive activities involve the potential and inherent risks of landing wrong, making contact with other participants, and/or objects within the VR experience.

Participating in these activities can also be tiring, and at times, physically demanding. Each participant, and the signing parent/legal guardian of minor participants, should know his or her physical limitations, prior medical history, and current condition. If there is any health condition which could potentially be affected by physical activities, then the participant should forego the same. Each participant should consult his or her physician if there is any question about the participant’s ability to engage in the activities offered by Releasees.  Some conditions that may impact a participant’s ability to safely engage in the activities could include pregnancy, current broken bones, high blood pressure, prior seizure disorder, or diagnosed/undiagnosed medical and mental conditions. This applies to all participants, whether adults or minors.

Additionally, Releasees utilize reasonable health related cleaning protocols to minimize the risk of COVID-19 and other disease transmission. However, there is a potential risk of contacting various viruses and other illnesses while participating.

It is further disclosed that there are other offerings at the entertainment facility, including a bar, dining room, game bays, and others. As such, any of the risks noted above could apply to these areas of the facility as well.

I acknowledge that the foregoing risks and information have been disclosed to me, and the minor(s) upon whose behalf I execute this Agreement. I further confirm that I have explained the foregoing to the minor(s).

## ACCEPTANCE OF RISKS

I UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT the foregoing risks and agree that my and the minor’s/minors’ participation, is purely voluntary, and not an activity that is of essential public service.  On behalf of myself and the minor(s), understand and accept the risks which may result in personal injury or wrongful death claims against Releasees,  including:

1. those risks set forth above;
2. the acts, omissions or negligence of Releasees, or their agents or employees;
3. latent or apparent defects or conditions in equipment, property or the facilities provided by Releasees;
4. the unexpected behavior of co-participants;
5. first aid, emergency treatment or services rendered or failed to be rendered by Releasees, or their agents or employees;
6. any COVID-19 or other virus/illness from the participation.

I further understand that if I, or any of the minor(s) are injured on today’s date or any future date, and require medical assistance, the cost of the same will be at the expense of myself and/or medical insurer for the participant, and neither I, or the minor(s) will seek the recovery of the same from Releasees.

I acknowledge that I, on behalf of myself and/or the minor(s), fully accept the foregoing risks. I FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE that the undersigned, and/or the minor(s):

1. are in good physical and mental health, and not suffering from any medical or emotional condition, disease or disablement;
2. will not seek recovery of any medical expenses from Releasees if I and/or any of the minor(s) are injured. Further, I acknowledge that I am not purchasing or leasing the attraction/facilities, but rather, am being afforded a non-exclusive right to use the same.   Additionally, I acknowledge that Releasees are providing recreational services.

## RELEASE

I, on behalf of myself, and my heirs, estate, and personal representatives, voluntarily RELEASE, WAIVE and FOREVER DISCHARGE, and COVENANT NOT TO SUE Releasees, from and for any and all liability, claims, demands, actions or rights or action, which are related to, arise out of, or are in any way connected with the participation in the activities, including, but  not limited to, negligence or fault of Releasees to any degree, claims, actions or lawsuits for personal injury, wrongful death, survivor actions, and all other claims that could legally be made relating to injury, property damage or death. The scope of this paragraph, and agreement to waive, release and discharge Releasees, includes, but is in no way limited to, instruction (or claimed lack thereof), written or oral warnings (or claimed lack thereof), training (or claimed lack thereof), and even general use of the premises (inside and outside in the parking lot and entrance areas).

I acknowledge, and agree for myself, my heirs, estates and personal representatives, to give up the legal rights identified, which include the right to file and/or pursue any lawsuit, whatsoever, for personal injury, wrongful death, survivor actions, and all other claims that could legally be made relating to injury, property damage or death which occurs on this date, or any future date. And, that the scope of the Release provision will be to the fullest extent as recognized by the law of Washington.

## INDEMNITY

Since Washington law prevents a parent from waiving a personal injury or wrongful death, and in consideration of the grant of license to me and the minor(s), I further agree, promise and covenant, TO HOLD HARMLESS AND TO DEFEND AND INDEMNIFY Releasees  from all defense costs, including attorney's fees, or from any other costs incurred in connection with claims for bodily injury, wrongful death or property damage which may be filed by me or any of the minor(s) listed below.  Such indemnity and defense obligation shall further extend (but is not limited) to any claim, loss or lawsuit which alleges that any of Releasees were negligent, and further extends to any instance where I or any of the minor(s) negligently or intentionally caused any injury, death or damage to participants or other third parties in the course of the participation in the activities.

I acknowledge and agree to the foregoing terms of indemnity.

## RULES AND INSTRUCTIONS

I, on behalf of myself, and/or the minor(s), agree to read and obey all written and oral rules, instructions and signs, during all times during the activities.

I acknowledge and agree to the foregoing Rules and Instructions.

## ARBITRATION AND WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

In consideration of the services provided by Releasees, I, on behalf of myself, and specifically for the minor(s), agree that all disputes, claims, causes of action, which may arise in the future relating to, arising out of, or in connection with the use of the facilities and/or engaging in the activities, will be resolved only by arbitration. In making this agreement, I understand that I and/or the minor(s) are giving up the right to file a civil lawsuit, and also waiving the right to a trial by jury.  

I acknowledge and agree to the foregoing terms of the Arbitration and Waiver of Jury Trial provision.

## ENTIRE AGREEMENT  

I understand that this is the entire Agreement between the undersigned and Releasees, and that it cannot be modified or changed in any way by the representations or statements of Releasees or any employee or agent of Releasees, or by the undersigned. My electronic signature indicates that I have read this entire document, understand it completely, and agree to be bound by its terms.

## REPRESENTATIONS ON CAPACITY TO SIGN

I represent that when signing on behalf of a minor, I have the legal authority/capacity to electronically sign this document, and that I am the parent or legal guardian of the minor(s). I understand that execution of this document is an integral part of participation, and that if I do not have legal authority as represented, Releasees may seek the full recover of all attorneys’ fees and other costs from me, based upon fraud and/or the indemnity provision in this document. If I am signing this document on my own behalf, I represent that I am at least 18 years of age.

## PHOTO AND VIDEO RELEASE

By signing below, I, for myself, and the minor(s) agree that Releasees may use any photos or videos taken while I and/or the minor(s) are on the property, which depict me or the minors, for marketing materials, website, publications or other use, without any further consent being required, and without compensation.

By signing this document, and making the initials above, I fully understand that it affects the legal rights of myself, my heirs, personal representatives, or the minor(s). I further agree that if any portion of this Agreement is found to be void or unenforceable, the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. It is my intent that this document, and the terms thereof, will apply to all dates of participation at the Mirra location, whether today or in the future.

Please sign for yourself, and for each minor for which you are the legal guardian.
